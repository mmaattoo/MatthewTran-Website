        <p class="lead mb-4">Through my professional journey, I have conducted many fundraising events, one specifically for my local church, in which I have been able to raise over $10,000 to support struggling famililes as well as providing them with everyday essentials. Through these fundraising events, I have been able to learn how to utilize different softwares including Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. My experience in fundraising events as well as my organization skills has ultimately helped and assisted me with my financial literacy, which is something that I want to pass down to future genereations. Coming from a low-income area, I have tried to further progress myself with financial knowledge to help my family, and also my community. I would love to express my financial knowledge to everyone and give the best strategies and advice to those who are looking to build upon their financial skills. I was also a former Boy Scout, in which I have been able to express and show off my leadership capabilities and execute various service and community projects. One specifically was my Eagle Scout Project. I learned a lot through this project financially by using different softwares and apps like google calendar, sheets, excel, and many more. This project came with lots of time management and organization. I planned for six months and worked with a team to perform well in my project. I created different budgets and budget planning to ensure success within a one year period. I am really hoping that one day I can give hope to those who are struggling financially and show that any one is capable of doing their best. I would have a hard time with my family growing up financially, and I wanted a way to earn the most money for my family in the most effective way. Investment banking is a career that I want to pursue as a career. Investment banking is where people can give financial advice and consultancy to clients who are looking to better their life in the financial aspect. Investment bankers work long hours, making different calls and teaching different financial methods. Although this may seem rough, investment bankers do get a stable pay and it can really help out those who are struggling or are looking to find ways to have a more comfortable life. <br><br>
